2)Dependency injection by constrcutor  
3)Dependency injection of objects/beans  
4)Inner bean definitions  
5)Injection of collections of beans  
6)Autowire byName  
7)Autowire byType  
8)Autowire by constructor  
9)Bean Scopes(singleton,prototype)  
10)Bean definition inheritance  
11)Initialization and destruction methods of spring   
12)Custom initialization and destruction methods    
13)Bean post processors  
14)Bean factory post processors  
15)Property place holders  
16)Annotation(@Autowired,@Component,@Qualifier)  
17)Reading messages from property file  


## Points to be noted

* Run individual test cases inside /SpringSample/src/test/java/com/home/spring/test/TestSpringProject.java as *JUnit test*.  
* TestCase name is self explanatory  
* Project code has java docs, comments for better understanding  
* After running the test case, check the console output to understand the flow  
* Comment non related bean definitions(refer testCaseName in spring.xml)
* Uncomment required bean definitions(refer testCaseName in spring.xml)

*Note: This project needs to be refactored to use best practices which will be done later. As of now this code should be used only for understanding purposes.*




* *Note: Run individual test cases instead of running all the test cases together to understand better. Comment non related bean definitions in spring.xml so that you will not get confused when other beans get loaded in spring container. Test case name is mentioned on top of the bean definitions which are required for that particular test case to run properly so make sure to uncomment all the bean definitions required for that test case, so please search the spring.xml from top to bottom before running the test case.*
